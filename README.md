# odin-dashboard

This is a dashboard project I built for the Odin Project online course. The objective was to practice page layout using CSS Grids. I tried to also use Flexbox where it seemed appropriate to me. 
The biggest challenge on this project was getting SVGs to work properly. I had to remember that you can only modify their attributes directly if you use them as inline elements.
